# SaaS_Churn_Prediction
Churn &amp; Revenue Analysis for Customer Retention in a Fast Growing SaaS Startup

Problem Statement: 
A B2B SaaS startup is growing rapidly but quietly losing customers. Revenue looks healthy, but the "Silent Churn" decaying product usage and unresolved technical frustration threatens the upcoming Series B funding round. This project builds an early-warning system to identify at-risk accounts before they cancel.

Techinal Architecture:
This repository contains a full-stack data engine:
  - Data Generation: A Python-based engine that simulates 250 companies with realistic behavioral decay (15-20% monthly usage drops for churners).
  - NLP Pipeline: Sentiment scoring and topic extraction from unstructured support tickets.
  - Relational Schema

Problems Solved:
  - Identifies frustration in messy, unstructured support data
  - Detects behavioral decay months before it shows up in revenue
  - Improves customer relationship and retention
  - Informs product strategy
